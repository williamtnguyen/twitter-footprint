## Inspiration 
We all use Twitter a lot and gain tons of entertainment from it. This all can't be freeâ€” everything comes at a cost. We wanted to raise social awareness of the environmental impacts of using the social media, and the web in general.

## How we built it 
We built the web-application using Node.js as a server side language, Express as a backend framework, a Python script to scrape the user's Twitter data, and a Javascript file as a bridge between the Python script and Node.js. We also used standard HTML for markup, SCSS/CSS for efficient styling, and Bootstrap for a responsive user-interface. We utilized Github as a version control, and then deployed to Heroku for public access.
